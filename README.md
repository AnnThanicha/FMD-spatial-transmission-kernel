# FMD-spatial-transmission-kernel
This is r code to estimate spatial transmission kernel parameter using maximum likelihood function.
Before starting, you need to prepare the outbreak data into two excel files.
1. Distance between farm (file distancematrix.xlsx)
2. Outbreak data : farmID,	farm size, 	infection date,	start tinfectious date,	stop infectious date, immunity waning date (file farmdata.xlsx)

For details about how to calculate infectious date, immunity waning date. Please read the assumption in the report.
